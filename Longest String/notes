declare a function

pass the string in as a parameter
    so what ever you feed the function
        aka an argument
            will be a string
                writen in the ()
                    of the function

Next you want to split up the string
    into an array
        .split method
            makes every word into an
                indexed element of an array 
Second variable
    will be left empty
        bc it will be the longest word 
Then we need to
    loop through the array
        with a "for of" loop  
So now your getting each and evey word 
    in the array  
If conditional statement
    which measures the length of 
        (add the .length to each variable)
            every variable against one another
                using  greater then

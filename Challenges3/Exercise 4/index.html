    <h1>JavaScript Exercise/Challenge</h1>
    <h3>(Find Highest Even Number)</h3>
    <pre>
        <b><u>Objective</u></b>: Write a JavaScript program                     <b><u>Notes</u></b>:
                    to get the largest even number                        - its going to have two functions
                        from an array of integers.                          1) extract all the even numbers from an array 
                                                                            2) get the highest number in an array 
        <b><u>Steps</u></b>:
            - create a variable thats an array of numbers
            - create a variable function that will take an array as it's parameter 
                - make sure not to hard code the parameter, 
                - so give it something very general that pertains to numbers
                    (aka "values")
            - note we are looking for the highest even number 
                - 2 conditions but one value 
            - so lets create a variable within this function 
                that will be the return value ending our function 
                    and given that we are looking for the highest number lets set it's value to zero 
            - then we need the function to look at every single number with in the array 
                so we will use a for loop through the array 
                    one at a time starting from the first index 
                        and ending when the number of iterations in the loop 
                            is the same as the amount of numbers in the array 
            - every time an iteration occurs 
                we need to check if 
                    the value is greater then our return variable of zero 
                    and that the number is an even number 
                        if these two conditions are true 
                            then the value being looked at during that iteration 
                                will replace our in house return variable 
        <b><u>Code</u></b>:
        <b><u>Results</u></b>:
                <span id="test1"></span>
    </pre>
    <script>
        const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

        const largestEvenNumber = (values) => {
            let highest = 0;
            for (let i = 0; i < values.length; i += 1) {
                if (values[i] > highest && values[i] % 2 == 0) {
                    highest = values[i];
                }
                console.log(highest); // this will keep track of the iterations in the loog
            }
            return highest;
        }

        document.getElementById("test1").innerHTML = largestEvenNumber(numbers);

    // There version 
        const largestEven = (arr) => Math.max(...arr.filter(num => num % 2 === 0));
